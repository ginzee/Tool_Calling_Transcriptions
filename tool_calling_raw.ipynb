    "1. With tool calling\n",

    "When you define a tool like:\n",

    "\n",
    "…the model already knows it must give you an age. You don’t have to show it lots of prior Q&A examples; the schema is the example.\n",

    "\n",
    "row_messages = [\n",
    "  {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Return the patient's age in whole years. If unknown, use -1.\"},\n",
    "  {\"role\": \"user\",   \"content\": text}  # <-- the transcription from THIS row\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you still want to give “demo” examples (few-shot)\n",
    "\n",

    "base_messages = [\n",

    "  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": '{\"age\": 23}'}\n",
    "]\n",
